Optimizing Traffic Fleet Management and​ Reducing Traffic Congestion

### Summary
This project optimizes taxi fleet management using Big Data Management tools like Apache Spark. ​
Some of our project objectives are,​
1. Analyze historical and real-time taxi trip data from the City of Chicago​
2. Identify high-demand pickup areas, peak hours, and traffic congestion hotspots​
3. Propose fleet reallocation strategies

### Methodology
1. Utilized Databricks and Apache Spark to perform distributed data processing and analysis
2. The dataset was preprocessed, cleaned, and aggregated to analyze trip volumes, fare distribution, and pickup/drop-off locations across various timeframes and geographic regions

### Dataset
The City of Chicago taxi trip data set was used for this analysis. ​
It contains fare amounts, trip miles, trip durations, pickup and drop-off timestamps, and the geographical location (community area) of pickups and drop-offs.​
Data Pre-processing, Descriptive Statistics, Demand Analysis, Congestion Analysis, Fleet Reallocation Recommendations​
